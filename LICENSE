GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and
other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that prevent
others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients that
you received. You must make sure that everyone else also receives or
can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify it.

For the developers' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no
warranty for this free software. For both users' and developers' sake,
the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed so that
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.

Some software is released under licenses that are not copyleft. This
means you are not required to pass on the same freedoms to others. By
contrast, the GNU General Public License requires that derived works
be licensed as a whole under the same license, ensuring that everyone
else also has these freedoms. We call this copyleft.

This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution and Modification

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright holder" is the individual, team, or organization holding
the copyright for the covered work.

"Covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

"Modify" means to make changes to the contents of the Program or to
combine the Program with other code, in such a way that the Program
becomes a new work.

"Propagate" means to make copies of the Program or its derivatives
available to others, whether gratis or for a fee.

"Convey" means to transfer a copy of the Program from one party to
another.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable.

2. Basic Permissions.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute the Program, as long as
you comply with the terms of this License. You must distribute the
source code along with the Program and include a copy of this License
in all copies of the Program you distribute.

3. Copyleft.

You must keep intact all copyright notices and disclaimers of warranty.

4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey modified versions of the Program under the terms of
Section 2. You must mark the modified versions of the Program as
changed, so that others know that they are not the original.

5. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey non-source forms of the Program, such as compiled
binaries, provided that you include the source code and the same
License.

6. Combination with Non-GPL-Compatible Software.

You may combine the Program with other software, and convey the
combination, provided that you comply with the terms of this License
for the Program and that the combined work is licensed under the GPL.

7. Additional Terms.

You may add your own terms to the License, provided that these terms
do not conflict with the License's requirements.

8. Termination.

If you fail to comply with the License, you lose your rights to the
Program unless you cure the breach within 30 days.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License to use the Program.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

You may convey the Program to others under the terms of this License,
even if the recipient does not accept the License.

11. No Warranty.

The Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The
entire risk of using the Program is with you.

12. Limitation of Liability.

In no event will any copyright holder or other party be liable to you
for damages arising from the use of this software.

13. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If any provision of this License is inconsistent with other licenses or
legal obligations, the provisions of this License shall prevail.

14. License Adaptations.

If the Program is designed to work with a particular operating system
or hardware device, you may add license terms that permit you to
obtain an upgrade, bug fixes, or other improvements to the Program.

15. Versioning.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised versions of the GPL.
If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GPL
applies, you have the option of following the terms of that version or
any later version.

16. How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs.

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be covered by this
License, you must include a copy of this License and the source code
along with the program. You must also provide a prominent notice that
the program is licensed under this License.
